This is the code for compiling the graph format of molecule file. 
Please make sure that you have the molecule files descripted in the TU datatset shaped format.
For example, if you have the graph of protein. The nodes are amino acid types and edges are the distance between the amino acid.
To make the above concept more clear, I provide one sample file for demo.
Hope you have fun : )
